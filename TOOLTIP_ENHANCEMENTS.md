# Enhanced Tooltip System for Linear Algebra Visualizer

## Overview
Added a comprehensive modernistic tooltip system that provides helpful information when users hover over tools and interface elements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Modern Tooltip Component (`/src/components/ui/Tooltip.tsx`)
- **Glassmorphic Design**: Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur effects
- **Smart Positioning**: Automatically adjusts position based on viewport boundaries
- **Smooth Animations**: 300ms transition with scale and opacity effects
- **Rich Content**: Supports both title and descriptive text
- **Responsive**: Works on both desktop hover and touch interfaces

### 2. Tool Selection Tooltips (Control Panel)
Each tool now has descriptive tooltips:

- **Vector Tool**: "Visualize vectors, add/remove vectors, and perform vector operations like addition and scalar multiplication"
- **Matrix Transformations**: "Explore linear transformations using matrices. Adjust matrix values and see how they transform space"
- **Subspaces**: "Visualize vector spans, linear independence, and subspace properties like lines and planes"
- **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**: "Analyze eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices. See special directions that only get scaled"
- **Basis Vectors**: "Work with different coordinate systems and basis vectors. Change how we measure and represent vectors"

### 3. Canvas Controls Tooltips
- **Zoom In**: "Zoom into the visualization for a closer view"
- **Zoom Out**: "Zoom out from the visualization for a wider view"  
- **Reset View**: "Reset zoom and pan to the default view position"

### 4. Header Navigation Tooltips
- **Documentation**: "Access tutorials and guides for linear algebra concepts"
- **Share**: "Share your current visualization with others"
- **GitHub**: "View the project source code on GitHub"
- **Logo**: "Interactive tool for visualizing vectors, matrices, transformations, and linear algebra concepts"

### 5. Display Settings Tooltips
- **Grid Toggle**: "Show or hide the coordinate grid for better spatial reference"
- **Labels Toggle**: "Show or hide vector labels and coordinate information"
- **Mode Toggle**: Dynamic tooltip that changes based on current mode

### 6. Vector Controls Tooltips
- **Add Vector**: "Create a new vector by specifying its components"
- **Expression Builder**: "Create complex vector expressions using addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication"
- **Reset Vectors**: "Reset all vectors to the default standard basis vectors"

## Technical Implementation

### Tooltip Component Features:
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed with proper interfaces
- **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA attributes and keyboard support
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses refs to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- **Viewport Awareness**: Automatically repositions to stay visible
- **Customizable**: Supports different positions, delays, and styling

### Styling Approach:
- **Modern Glassmorphism**: `bg-gray-900/90 backdrop-blur-md`
- **Enhanced Shadows**: `shadow-2xl border border-gray-700/50`
- **Smooth Animations**: `transition-all duration-300 ease-out`
- **Responsive Sizing**: `max-w-xs` with proper text wrapping

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Educational Value**: New users can understand what each tool does without trial and error
2. **Reduced Learning Curve**: Descriptive tooltips explain complex linear algebra concepts
3. **Better Discoverability**: Users can explore features more confidently
4. **Professional Feel**: Modern design enhances the overall application polish
5. **Accessibility**: Tooltips work with keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions could include:
- Interactive tooltips with links to documentation
- Context-sensitive help based on current tool state  
- Progressive disclosure for advanced features
- Custom tooltip themes for different tool categories
- Animation tutorials within tooltips

## Usage
The tooltip system is now active throughout the application. Simply hover over any tool, button, or interface element to see helpful information about its functionality.
